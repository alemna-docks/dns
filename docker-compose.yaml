# Unbound can be both a recursive DNS server and an authoritative DNS
# server simultaneously, but in this scenario we're only going to be 
# using it as a recursive DNS server while we leave the authoritative
# role to NSD. 

# This lets us keep a nice separation of duties. Unbound will be the 
# "frontend" DNS server that all our devices send requests to, while 
# NSD will be the "backend" DNS server that holds all our internal DNS
# records. When Unbound recieves requests for internal IP addresses or 
# DNS records it will start recursively resolving the request by turning 
# to NSD, and when it recieves requests for external IP addresses or DNS
# records it will start recursively resolving the request by turning to
# the internet's DNS root servers.
