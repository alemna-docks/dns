    # Time to live maximum for RRsets and messages in the cache. If the maximum
    # kicks in, responses to clients still get decrementing TTLs based on the

    # often, and not trust (very large) TTL values.

    # Time to live minimum for RRsets and messages in the cache. If the minimum
    # kicks in, the data is cached for longer than the domain owner intended,
    # and thus less queries are made to look up the data. Zero makes sure the
    # data in the cache is as the domain owner intended, higher values,

    # the cache does not match up with the actual data any more.
